This contains a short presentation on Vagrant and Ansible as well as 4
examples ranging from simple shell provisioning to an automated Drupal 8
installation from git

The following links were of great help to me when I prepared the presentation
and the examples:

https://austin2014.drupal.org/session/devops-humans-ansible-drupal-deployment-victory.html
https://adamcod.es/2014/09/23/vagrant-ansible-quickstart-tutorial.html
https://github.com/geerlingguy/ansible-vagrant-examples

Step #5 in the 8th slide of the presentation: Re-using other peopleâ€™s roles, is not detailed by an example. If you follow the third link above, however, you are sure to find lots of useful examples!
